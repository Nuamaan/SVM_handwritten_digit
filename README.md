# SVM_handwritten_digit
Handwritten digit classification using custom built SVM through CVXPY library. Here, soft classifier SVMs have been used. 
The notebook also contains the code for Instace and Hypothesis Transfer Learning using SVM. Both the Transfer Learning procedures are for learning 
the 1 vs 7 classification (target problem ) using an SVM classifier trained on 1 vs 9 classification.
